Random music phrase generator. A basic, but fundamental ear-training tool.

There is plenty of amazing ear-training software out there on the web, like [this](https://miles.be) 
and [this](https://www.iwasdoingallright.com/tools/ear_training/online/). But what's the point of 
learning to identify intervals, rhythms, etc. if you can't play what you hear?

## Usage

Change some settings (or don't) and hit the play button. You *should* hear a generated phrase using some (or all)
of the notes in your selection, followed by a bar of silence (well, there should still be a click). The idea being
that you should attempt to copy what you heard on your chosen instrument in the gap provided.

## As is

I built this purely for my own use, but if it works for you, great. If not, ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

So far, this has only tested positive in Chromium on Linux and Chromium on Android.
